A **Kit** is a single, self-contained markdown instruction file that represents one atomic agent execution.

A Kit:

1. **Defines one coherent unit of work**: Can be a component, flow, feature, or entire app

2. **Contains complete instructions + code + structure**: Everything needed for that unit in one file

3. **Is technology-agnostic**: Works across any technology stack

4. **Is modular, reusable, and parameterizable**: Uses tokens for customization and adaptation

5. **Is AI-agent ready**: 1 kit → 1 agent context → 1 execution

6. **Is not tied to any project**: Tokens make it adaptable to different contexts

In short:

➡️ A Kit is the atomic instruction set for a single agent run, containing everything needed to build one modular piece of software.
