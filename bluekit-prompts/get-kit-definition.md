A **kit** is a single markdown file that provides generic, modular instructions for building software components. It can include:

1. **Scope flexibility**: Can contain anything from:

   - Small, reusable components (UI components, backend utilities, etc.)

   - Larger features or flows

   - Entire applications (frontend, backend, or full-stack)

   - Any combination of the above

2. **Technology agnostic**: Works for:

   - Frontend components (UI elements, views, flows)

   - Backend components (APIs, services, utilities)

   - Full-stack applications

   - Any technology stack

3. **Modular and composable**: Each component is:

   - Self-contained with complete code and instructions

   - Selectable independently

   - Can be combined with other components

   - Includes dependencies and relationships

4. **AI-agent ready**: Designed to be used with Cursor or similar tools—point the agent at the kit and specify which components to build.

5. **Complete and self-contained**: Each component includes:

   - Full code implementations

   - File paths and structure

   - Dependencies between components

   - Build/setup instructions

   - Customization tokens

6. **Generic and reusable**: Not tied to a specific project—tokens can be replaced to adapt to different contexts.

In short: a kit is a modular, reusable instruction set for building software components of any size, from small utilities to entire applications, across frontend, backend, or full-stack.
