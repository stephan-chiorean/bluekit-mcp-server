A **walkthrough** is a single markdown file that provides a section-by-section, chapter-by-chapter walkthrough for understanding how code works. It can include:

1. **Understanding focus**: Designed to help understand:
   - How specific code sections work
   - How different parts of a system interact
   - The flow of data and logic through an application
   - Architecture and design patterns used
   - Step-by-step explanations of complex functionality

2. **Section-by-section breakdown**: Organized as:
   - Chapters or sections that build understanding progressively
   - Each section explains a specific part of the codebase
   - Clear progression from basic concepts to advanced details
   - Code examples with detailed explanations

3. **Code comprehension**: Helps understand:
   - What each component does and why
   - How components connect and interact
   - The reasoning behind design decisions
   - Dependencies and relationships between parts
   - Execution flow and data transformations

4. **AI-agent ready**: Designed to be used with Cursor or similar tools—point the agent at the walkthrough to understand how specific code works.

5. **Complete and educational**: Each walkthrough includes:
   - Clear explanations of concepts
   - Code examples with annotations
   - Visual or textual flow diagrams
   - Context about why things are structured a certain way
   - Progressive learning path

6. **Project-specific understanding**: Focused on understanding existing code—helps developers comprehend how a specific system or feature works.

In short: a walkthrough is a structured, educational guide for understanding how code works, organized section-by-section and chapter-by-chapter to build comprehensive understanding of a codebase or feature.
